> ### Thanks for finishing our positioning elements beta lesson!

Congratuations! At this point, you've got a *professional* foundation of HTML and CSS. Seriously! Once you've finished this problem set, you'll have demonstrated enough working knowledge to tackle *any* design. Of course, there's much more to learn about CSS, namely responsive design techniques, but if you've made it this far you'll have *no problem* taking on more advanced CSS topics.

Before I send you off to the problem set, I want you to see one more thing. Head back to the [example from the last quiz](http://udacity.github.io/fend/fend-refresh/lesson6-part2/clearfix-overflow-quiz.html). If you haven't already, I want you to resize the width of `.row`. This is what you'll see.

The layout changes as the width changes! This is the keystone technique for grid-based layouts, which you'll be exploring in the next lessons.

But first, a problem set! Time to test out your new layout techniques.
