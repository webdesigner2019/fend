Let's go back to the example site you saw at the beginning of the last page. I want you to use developer tools to fix it so that the `.sibling` element appears underneath the two "Child" divs.

<<img of the site as it should look>>
This is how I want the site to look.

You should only need to add one CSS property.

### Instructions

1. Open this site in your favorite browser. Make sure your Udacity Feedback extension is on.
2. Add CSS to make `.sibling` render below the floats.
3. Get a code from the extension and paste it into the box below!

// right
Nice job! But clearly, the page looks a little weird. The parent is still collapsed. Learn how to fix that on the next page!

// wrong
Doesn't look like the right code. It should appear in the Udacity Feedback extension widget.

// nada
You can do it! Just add some CSS to .sibling.
