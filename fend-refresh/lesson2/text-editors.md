There are many editors that can write plain text. In fact, you have one installed already regardless of the kind of computer you're using.

If you're on a PC, you have Notepad.

If you're on a Mac, you have TextEdit.

If you're using a Linux distribution, you have at least a command line text editor like [Nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano) or [Vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi). Some distributions might have a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) text editor installed as well.

While regular text editors work, they are slow because you have to type each and every character manually. When writing code, you'll notice pretty quickly that code structure is repetitive - you'll be writing code that looks the same over and over and over.

A regular text editor, like TextEdit or Notepad, isn't going to help you out. But text editors made for code will help you out with colorful syntax highlighting, auto-completing common blocks of code, automatic formatting and other ways you can't even imagine yet.

There is no "best" text editor. It's all a matter of personal preference. I want you to download at least two of these and try them out to see what you like.

### Sublime Text 3

**Windows, Mac, Linux**

**Cost**: $70USD (but free to try indefinitely with pop-ups)

**Style**: GUI

Sublime Text is fast, lightweight and easily customizable. With tons of keyboard shortcuts, multiple cursors and a huge ecosystem of plugins, you can create the perfect workflow.

However, updates to Sublime Text have recently started to slow, which makes some developers concerned. Many are flocking to...

### Atom

**Windows, Mac, Linux**

**Cost**: Free

**Style**: GUI

[Website](https://atom.io/)

Made by GitHub and a relative newcomer on the text editor scene, Atom looks and feels similar to Sublime Text. Both feature multiple cursors and they share many of the same keyboard shortcuts. Also much like Sublime Text, Atom has a rich ecosystem of packages that you can use to customize your editor to your heart's content.

Both Atom and Sublime Text are hugely popular and the majority of web developers that you'll meet will probably be using one or the other.

### Notepad++

**Windows**

**Cost**: Free

**Style**: GUI

[Website](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

A classic lightweight text editor, Notepad++ has been around since 2000.

Notepad++'s plugin ecosystem is not as large as Atom's or Sublime Text's, but many people like its clean (perhaps old school?) presentation.

### Emacs

**Windows, Mac, Linux**

**Cost**: Free

**Style**: Command-Line or GUI

Emacs is an open source text editor that's been around since the 1970s. Along with Vim, it's one of the most popular Linux text editors.

Emacs is often described as an operating system because even in a clean install there are several included applications that you wouldn't expect inside a text editor, like a news reader, several calculators, a number of games, file encryption/decryption, and a package manager for plugins written in [Emacs Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp).

All Emacs commands exist in the same namespace so it's not uncommon to differentiate commands by having chains of keystrokes like C-x C-f (Control - x, Control - f) to open a file. Because of the incredible customizability, it's among the editors with the steepest learning curves. You will most like want to customize it: installing plugins, trying them, testing for conflicts, uninstalling the ones that have conflicts, and repeating.

### Vi/Vim

**Windows, Mac, Linux**

**Cost**: Free and open source

**Style**: Command Line or GUI

Vim, or Vi IMproved is the other text editor in the [Unix Editor Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war).

Vim runs anywhere that standard C can run and is often in the base install for most Linux and non-Windows systems including Mac OS X. It also offers a fairly robust [tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/) to learn how to use it. Learn it once and you can use it everywhere.

*For experienced students (everyone else, it's ok if you don't understand this right now):* Vim relies on modes, or scopes, when certain commands are applicable. In the command mode, the user can move around a file or execute commands. For instance, in insert mode, you can edit a file. While you are creating a HTML file (and are in HTML mode), you might be able to expand `html:5` into the boilerplate for an empty HTML file.
