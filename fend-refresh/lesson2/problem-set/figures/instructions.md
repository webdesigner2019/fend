It's important to respect copyright and attribution on the web. When you use someone else's work, you need to give the author credit. With that in mind, for this quiz you're going to create an image with a caption underneath. I want you to give credit to the image's photographer by attributing them in the image's caption and providing a link to the source material.

This is what it should look like in your browser:

![an image with a caption underneath](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/HffH115RhYvKQqtGtlyJdpwmAGShI-TjpMx4WT2trGtBYVUXKe00E69K7Cg7TBX4QeW_eTy1QgBjwQLSiV4=s600)

### How to Complete this Quiz

1. Download the file called `figures.zip` from the downloadables section. You'll find `index.html` and an image inside.
2. Edit `index.html` so that the caption displays below the image. I want you to use a **relative** path to the image, which is going to be in the same directory as `index.html`. Remember, a relative path points to the file **from the current directory** - it does not start with the root. (Your relative path should *not* start with `/`, `file://`, `C:\`, or `http://`).
3. There's more than one option for completing this quiz **but you only have to complete one option!** You'll get a different code depending on how you complete it. Type the code into the box in the next screen to pass the quiz!

Hint: There is an HTML element made specifically for this situation! I recommend checking out the [figure element on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure).
