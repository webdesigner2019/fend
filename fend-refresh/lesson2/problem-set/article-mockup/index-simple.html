  <h2>My Breakfast</h2>
  <h4>A Love Story</h4>
  <p><em>By Cameron Pittman</em></p>
  <p>8 March 2016</p>
  <p>I <strong>love</strong> breakfast. It is, by far, the best meal of the day. ️And today, I had the best kind of breakfast: a <em>spicy</em> egg sandwich 🔥🔥🔥</p>
  <p>Waking up quickly and getting out of bed used to be a problem for me, but I got over it because of breakfast. It's a lot easier to get out of bed when I know I'm about to eat something delicious. As soon as my alarm rang this morning, I was already halfway into the kitchen.</p>
  <p>Spicy egg day starts with my mini egg pan 🍳I ignite the burner to prep the pan. While it's warming up, I start boiling water for coffee, down a glass of cold water (another great way to wake up) and refill my glass with orange juice 🍊</p>
  <p>I like my eggs over easy. Here's my recipe:
    <ol>
      <li>Drip a little bit of olive oil on the warm pan.</li>
      <li>Crack a large egg into the pan carefully so the yolk stays intact.</li>
      <li>Drench the egg in my hot sauce <em>du jour</em>.</li>
      <li>Cook until the egg white is white and firm (usually no more than two or three minutes).</li>
    </ol>
  <p>To turn it into a sandwhich, I slide the egg into an English muffin that I've toasted to a golden brown. If I'm feeling fancy, I'll put a slice of Muenster cheese on top.</p>
  <p>With my sandwich ready, I sit down with a cup of ☕️, open up the news and start the day off right!</p>
