### Project Overview

Hey there, web developer! Congratulations on making it this far! Here's your next project: **translating a mockup to HTML**. This is similar to the exercise from earlier in the problem set, except this article is going to be a bit more complicated. I'll be giving you a mockup of a website (and a copy of the text in it). It's going to be your job to recreate it with HTML.

You're going to see some formatting you haven't encountered before, so you'll need to use a resource, like the [MDN element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element), to research new elements.

### Project Instructions

0. Complete the problem set! This project will be much easier if you've finished every problem set exercise first.
0. Download and unzip `mockup-to-html.zip` from the downloadables section. You'll find `article.html`, the article mockup image and a file called `reflections.txt` inside.
1. Use what you've learned about web development so far to edit `article.html` so that it looks **exactly** like the mockup image. You will need to use new elements, which means that you'll need to [research](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and experiment! (Hint: they are called "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough.")
2. When you've finished building the article, open up `reflections.txt`. You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development in `reflections.txt`. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

### Project Submission

* Take a moment to double check that your `article.html` file renders *exactly* like the mockup!
* Make sure you've answered all the questions for the reflection. Feel free to use your native language! Graders will translate if necessary.
* Check your project against the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15WAIw1U_e-Vr1-Iny6RiDdjlIDIDitm7yJmxBD6hiT0/pub).
* Create a zip file containing `article.html` and `reflections.txt`.

Good luck! I know that you can do it ðŸš€
