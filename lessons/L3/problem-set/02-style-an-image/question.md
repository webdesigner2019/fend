For your first quiz, I want you to take this black and white image of a kitten and add some style to it.

_Aww, isn't it cute!_ üê±

I'll give you the image and the HTML, and it will be your job to add the style. But, you won't be adding just any style. Instead, you will need to use properties for `border`, `cursor`, and `box-shadow` to produce the following result.

_Hint: The color of the border is salmon (#fa8072)_

### Border

If you've ever used a table in a word processor or spreedsheet, then you should be familiar with borders. With CSS, you can add a border to just about anything. There are a ton of different options for customizing borders like style, width, and color! Click [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border "CSS Borders") to learn more.

### Cursor

It's possible you've never noticed your cursor change when viewing a website because it's so subtle. But, changing the cursor can be extremely helpful when trying to communicate things to the user. For example, if a user hovers over a link, changing the cursor to a pointer let's the user know the link can be clicked.

_A normal button on the left, and the same button while a mouse is hovering over it on the right_

For most situations your browser automatically changes the cursor, but you can use the cursor property to override its behavior. See [this demo](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/cursor/ "Cursors Demo") of all the different cursors in action! Obvisouly, this property only applies to users with a mouse üòâ .

### Box-Shadow

_Use shadows to add a sense of depth to images_

The box-shadow property is relatively new to the world of CSS. You can use it to add a shadow to an element. If you want to try experimenting with box-shadows, check out this [box-shadow generator](http://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow "Box-Shadow Generator") from CSSmatic.
