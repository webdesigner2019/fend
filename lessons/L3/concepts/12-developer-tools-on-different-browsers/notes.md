If you didn't, that's okay. Developer tools aren't always the easiest thing to find in your browser. So, we've decided to help you out by creating this guide to developer tools!

### Google Chrome

The Chrome DevTools are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome. Use the DevTools to iterate, debug and profile your site. To learn more, [click here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).

To open Chrome DevTools, either right-click on any page element and select `Inspect` or open the Chrome menu ![chrome menu](http://udacity.github.io/fend/lessons/L3/concepts/12-developer-tools-on-different-browsers/chrome-menu.png) in the top-right corner of your browser window and select `More Tools > Developer Tools`. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `⌘ + ⌥ + I` (Mac) or `Ctrl + ⇧ + I` (Windows/Linux).

### Mozilla Firefox

Firefox Developer Tools allow you to examine, edit, and debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the desktop and on mobile. Also, you can download a version of of Firefox called Firefox Developer Edition that is tailored for developers, featuring the latest Firefox features and experimental developer tools.

### Internet Explorer

For any Windows users, if you're still using a version of Internet Explorer, then you can access F12 developer tools by simply pressing `F12`. The features vary between versions, but starting at Internet Explorer 8 remain pretty consistent. Below, we've linked to documentation for each version, but if you've upgraded to Microsoft Edge, then check the next section.

- [Internet Explorer 11](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bg182636.aspx)

### Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge introduces great new improvements to the F12 developer tools seen in Internet Explorer. The new tools are built in TypeScript, and are always running, so no reloads are required. In addition, F12 developer tools documentation is now fully available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MicrosoftEdge-Documentation).

Just like Internet Explorer, to open developer tools in Microsoft Edge simply press `F12`.
